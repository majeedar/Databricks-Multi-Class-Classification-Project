# Databricks-Multi-Class-Classification-Project
This project focuses on building and evaluating a multi-class classification model using Databricks, leveraging its powerful tools for data preparation, model building, and MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) with MLflow and Hyperopt.
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a robust multi-class classification model capable of predicting a target variable based on a given dataset. The project is structured into two main blocks: Data Preparation and Exploration, and Model Building and Evaluation.

Block I: Data Preparation and Exploration
This phase is dedicated to understanding the dataset, cleaning it, and preparing it for machine learning.

1. Dataset Import
The project begins by importing the provided dataset, which is in CSV format, directly into the Databricks environment. This ensures the data is accessible for further processing within the Spark ecosystem.

2. Descriptive Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A thorough descriptive analysis and EDA are performed to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics. This includes:

Descriptive Statistics: Calculating key statistical measures (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical features.

Summary Tables: Generating aggregated views of the data to highlight distributions and relationships.

Visualizations: Creating histograms to visualize feature distributions and pair plots to understand relationships between different features.

3. Feature Preparation
This step involves identifying and preparing the features that will be used for model training.

Missing Value Identification: Detecting any missing values within the dataset.

Missing Value Handling: Implementing strategies to address missing values (e.g., imputation, removal).

Data Transformations: Applying necessary transformations to features to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms (e.g., scaling, normalization).

4. Target Variable Transformation
The target variable, initially in a categorical format, is transformed into a numerical representation. This is a crucial step as most machine learning algorithms require numerical input for the target variable in classification tasks.

5. Final Analytical Dataset
The culmination of this block is a clean, well-prepared analytical dataset. This dataset is ready to be fed into machine learning models, ensuring data quality and consistency for the subsequent modeling phase.

Block II: Model Building and Evaluation
This phase focuses on developing, optimizing, and tracking a multi-class classification model.

1. Basic Multi-Class Classification
A foundational multi-class classification model is implemented using a chosen algorithm from Databricks' MLLib package. Examples of algorithms that can be utilized include:

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Logistic Regression

2. Model Tracking with MLflow
MLflow is integrated throughout the model building process to ensure proper tracking and management of experiments. This includes:

Logging Models: Saving trained models for future use and deployment.

Tracking Performance Metrics: Recording key evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for each model run.

Visualizing Model Comparisons: Utilizing MLflow's UI to compare the performance of different model iterations and experiments, facilitating informed decision-making.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning
To optimize model performance, Hyperopt is employed for automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Hyperopt helps in efficiently searching for the best combination of hyperparameters that yield the highest model performance, reducing manual effort and improving results.

Technologies Used
Databricks: The primary platform for data processing, machine learning, and MLOps.
